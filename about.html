                    Hey there! I'm Gabe. I've been passionately gaming as far as I could remember. Gaming was more than just a pass-time for me as a kid. It was my foundational support, a second home, and a way to escape; not only for myself, but my brother as well. He is a childhood stage-4 cancer survivor, and 90% of both of our childhoods were spent in hospitals from age 2-12 as he constantly received treatment. Despite the horrendous treatment and pain he had to go through, our fondest memories were the dozens of games we'd play together in between it all. Even now, our biggest bonds are the games we play. Thus, I am not ashamed to admit how much these games mean to me and those around me. I am passionate about this industry, its developments, and the constant flow of masterpieces that great us yearly from various studios. Their stories, struggles, and successes are what shape the future of games for all.

                    Amongst them all, there is one game that stands out as the single greatest experience I've ever had in this medium. And it isn't even close...

                        <p class="game-description">
                            Larian Studios proved they had the skills to make something special after DOS2. Nobody could've predicted exactly how special this "something" would be, however; Baldur's Gate 3 unequivocally stands as the richest, most interactive RPG ever created. With a truly cinematic, epic 100+ hour campaign, every single choice the player makes has a significant and meaningful outcome on the story; which is why even after 1000+ hours I am still finding new items to collect, new characters to meet, and new beasts to incinerate.

                            The foundation of BG3 is based on the D&D 5e ruleset. Combining the free-form, choose your own adventure play that Dungeons and Dragons already brings with a studio who's last game was built on a physics playground for combat was a miracle for all to play. With a cast of incredibly fleshed out companions, villains, and monsters to slay, BG3 invites you to roll the dice on it, and I can confirm that this game is absolutely a natural 20. A critical hit.
