                <p class="article-text">
                    Sandfall Studios dropped the equivalent of a nuclear bomb onto the AAA gaming scene with their French-inspired, turn based RPG <em>Expedition 33</em> back in Spring. The setting of Lumiere and the cast of emotional characters as they push through the impossible task of reaching the Paintress immediately captivated millions, and that immense adoration has seemingly lasted all the way to the recent Game Awards nominations. Online support makes it clear that the game is likely to dominate the Game of the Year award, and I am all for it. <em>Expedition 33</em> was absolutely the best game I've played this year, and has solidified itself into my top 5 games of all time. I cannot wait to see the reactions from Sandfall as they are handed dozens awards in the coming months.

                <h2 class="article-title">Netflix to Acquire Warner Bros. Following the Separation of Discovery Global for a Total Enterprise Value of $82.7 Billion</h2>
                <p class="article-subtitle">
                    This acquisition includes all the video game IPs WB owns, meaning Netflix now owns Harry Potter, LOTR, and more.

                <p class="article-text">
                    This is going to be rough, for both sides. Not even talking about how this will affect movies going forward, the popular IPs that Warner Bros. owns include Harry Potter, DC, Lord of the Rings, and much more are now all in the hands of Netflix. Netflix games has been a mere mobile-focused, low effort streaming market, and now these IPs are joining that market... likely to poor reception from fans. Who benefits besides those making $$$ from the merger?
